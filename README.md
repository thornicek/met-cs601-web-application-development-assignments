# Met CS 601 Web Application Development Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments I did for my Web Application Development class. This was a front end development class and the majority of code was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
We learned different techniques, such as mainpulating dynamic CSS or embedding videos and mp4 files. We also covered AJAX, XML and JSON, as we used them to transfer data from client and server.
