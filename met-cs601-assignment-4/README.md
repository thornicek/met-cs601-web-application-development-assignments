# CS601 Assignment 4 Tomas Hornicek

For the first of my assignment 4, I have created the folder "CSS". In this folder I have created the file "CSShw.html", where I put an input field and a paragraph in the body. I have attached a CSS file, "Style.css", to the html page, modified the input box and made the paragraph elements to show the image file, "cloud2.jpeg", in the background.

For the second part of my assignment, I have created the folder "CSS Basics". In this folder I have created a html page, "CssBasics.html" to which I have attached the CSS file, "Style.css", where I gave each div a different kind of styling.

For the third part of the assignment, I have created the folder "CSS HW". In this folder I have created a html page, "CSSTomas.html" to which I have attached the styling sheet "Practice.css". In the html page I have explored the functions of different allignments of elements on a web page, the difference in size between different header elements and I have embedded the file "Help.jpeg". In the CSS file, I have edited the table elements, resized the headings, adjusted the margins and set the italics and the background color.
