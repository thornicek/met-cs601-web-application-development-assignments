# CS601 Assignment 3 Tomas Hornicek

For my first part of assignment 3, I have implemented an audio file, "epic.mp3", with controls, in a html page EpicAudio.html. The code for the first part, can be found in the folder "Audio HTML".

For my second part of assignment 3, I have created a html page, "PeopleWalking.html", where I embedded a video file, "PeopleWalking.mp4". I have also set the preload picture to be "PeopleWalkingPoster.png". The files for the second part of the assignment can be found in the folder VideoHTML.
