# CS601 Assignment 1 Tomas Hornicek

For Assignment 1, I have used pure HTML5(No CSS, JS, or other language), to generate my own resume, which resides in the file "tomas_resume.html". For my second part of the assignment I have used HTML5 to generate a biography page about my favourite NHL player, Jaromir Jagr. Files for the second part of the assignment can be found in the folder "Homework1". For the second part I have used the same HTML5 elements, except this time I have also embedded an image into the web page.
