# CS601 Assignment 2 Tomas Hornicek

For my first part of assignment 2, I have created the file "html_form.html", where I programmed in HTML5 a basic web page with a form, where the user fills out their information.

For the second part of the assignment, I have created a folder "Homework2", where I have created a html page, "Celtics.html", which contains the table of the Boston Celtics top players, their photos and their stats.
